title: Self Portability II - Make yourself free from switching software

I've made a post titled ["Self Portability"](/essay/2017/01/28/self-portability/) previously. In that, I wrote as follows:

At the heart of this quote, I meant we shouldn't get accustomed to specific tools too much. If you're too hooked into a tool, say, Emacs, it brainwashes you to think things in Emacs way. Trust me. I was one of the guys before.

If you get addicted to Emacs, you want everything to work the same as Emacs. If you can't use Emacs key-bind in your Google Chrome, you'll get upset. When you try using IntelliJ, you'll throw it away 5 minutes after installing it because Emacs-mode of it is slightly different from your *actual* Emacs.

It's no good. Don't get addicted to specific software.

You should be able to choose the right software any time. In my opinion, IntelliJ or VS Code is the way to go if you're a programmer. Use one of them. Fully embrace the features they provide. *BUT*, don't get too accustomed to them either. In the future, there appears better software. History proves it.
